# Tcf7Th17paper

Code used in Mangani et al

## RNA-seq

  * `rnaseq_analysis.R`: differential gene expression analysis for bulk RNA-seq data; makes Figure 6A, 6B, 7B and 7C
  * `rnaseq_revisions_Th_signature_score.R`: figure showing the Th signature score in RNA-seq, TCF1cKO vs WT
  
## ATAC-seq  

  * `atacseq_qc_preprocessing.R`: ATAC-seq QC and pre-processing
  * `atacseq_analysis.R`: differential accessibility analysis for bulk ATAC-seq data; makes Figure 6F, 6G and 7E
  * `atacseq_revisions_DA_peaks_htmap.R`: heatmap showing the ATAC-seq DA peaks, TCF1cKO vs WT

## Network analysis

 * `build_network.R`: constructs regulatory network using both RNA- and ATAC-seq data.
